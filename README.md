The provided code is an implementation of the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in Python. The Caesar Cipher is a simple substitution cipher where each letter in the original message is replaced by a letter a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

Here's a breakdown of the code:

1. Encryption Function (encrypt):
   -The function takes two arguments: message (the message to be encrypted) and shift (the number of positions to shift the letters).
   -It initializes an empty list encrypted_chars to store the encrypted characters.  
   -It iterates over each character char in the message.
   -If char is an alphabetic character (checked using char.isalpha()), it performs the following steps:
       -Determines the base ASCII value for uppercase ('A') or lowercase ('a') letters using ord('A') or ord('a'), respectively.
       -Calculates the encrypted character by shifting the character's ASCII value by the shift value, taking the modulus with 26 (to wrap around the alphabet), and adding the base ASCII value.
       -Appends the encrypted character to the encrypted_chars list.
   -If char is not an alphabetic character, it is appended to the encrypted_chars list as is.
   -Finally, it joins the characters in the encrypted_chars list into a single string and returns it as the encrypted message.

2. Decryption Function (decrypt):
   -The function takes two arguments: encrypted_message (the message to be decrypted) and shift (the number of positions to shift the letters).
   -It initializes an empty list decrypted_chars to store the decrypted characters.
   -It iterates over each character char in the encrypted_message.
   -If char is an alphabetic character, it performs the following steps:
       -Determines the base ASCII value for uppercase ('A') or lowercase ('a') letters using ord('A') or ord('a'), respectively.
       -Calculates the decrypted character by shifting the character's ASCII value by the negative shift value, adding 26 to handle negative values, taking the modulus with 26 (to wrap around the alphabet), and adding the base ASCII value.
       -Appends the decrypted character to the decrypted_chars list.
   -If char is not an alphabetic character, it is appended to the decrypted_chars list as is.
   -Finally, it joins the characters in the decrypted_chars list into a single string and returns it as the decrypted message.

3. Main Function (main):
   -This function provides a command-line interface for the user to interact with the Caesar Cipher program.
   -It displays a menu with options to encrypt a message, decrypt a message, or quit the program.
   -Based on the user's choice, it prompts for the message and shift value, calls the appropriate encryption or decryption function, and displays the result.
   -The loop continues until the user chooses to quit the program.

The code uses ASCII values to perform the encryption and decryption operations, taking advantage of the fact that the letters in the alphabet are represented by consecutive ASCII values. By shifting the ASCII values and wrapping around the alphabet using modular arithmetic, the program can encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
